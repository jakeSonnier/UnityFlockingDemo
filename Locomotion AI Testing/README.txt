Altogether, The first 3 behaviours were significantly easier to implememnt than the flocking behaviours. The Fleeing, Seeking, and 
Offset Pursuing behaviours are stable and operate accordingly.

       -this video series was of great help in not only learning flocking but also learning about c# scripting 
	in Unity. The tutorial was geared for a 2D environment, and I had some trouble adapting the scripting for a
	3D environment. Overall, the boids do flock, but they have no weighted incentive to change direction and
	certainly do not stay within a certain bound. The previously mentioned upgrades would significantly 
	bolster the behaviour of the boids.
